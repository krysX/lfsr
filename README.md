### LFSR

A command-line tool for generating pseudo-random numbers on a console interface. 
It uses a 32-bit *Linear Feedback Shift Register **(LFSR)*** to generate numbers.

This is a hobby project made for fun and to learn about how LFSRs work
(and also for that feeling of reinveting the wheel.)

The program is written in C.
