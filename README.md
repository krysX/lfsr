### LFSR

A simple command-line tool written in C for generating pseudo-random numbers on a console interface. 
It uses a 32-bit *Linear Feedback Shift Register **(LFSR)*** to generate numbers.

This is my first attempt at a CLI application that can handle arguments.

Use -h for help or run without arguments for an interactive mode.
The executable is a Linux executable.

This is a hobby project made for learning purposes.
